    Answer the question: {question}
    
    ⚠️ CRITICAL - FOLLOW EXACTLY IN THIS ORDER:
    
    STEP 1 (MANDATORY): 
    - Call the "Language Detector" tool with the EXACT question text: {question}
    - DO NOT make assumptions about language based on the topic or location mentioned
    - The tool will return either 'ar' or 'en'
    - Record this result
    
    STEP 2:
    - Call the "search_heritage" tool to find relevant information
    
    STEP 3:
    - Write your answer in the language detected in STEP 1:
      * If STEP 1 returned 'ar' → Write ONLY in Arabic
      * If STEP 1 returned 'en' → Write ONLY in English
    
    ❌ WRONG: "The question is about Gaza, so I'll answer in Arabic"
    ✅ CORRECT: "The question is written in English, so I'll answer in English"
    
    The LANGUAGE of the question matters, NOT the topic/location mentioned in it.

  expected_output: >
    Heritage information in the same language as the question was asked.
    Start with: "Detected Language: [ar/en]"
